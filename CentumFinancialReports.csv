We aim to engage proactively with those of whom we have an impact and with those who impact us. This informs the development and evaluation of our strategy, risk management framework and subsequently our material issues.

Some of the Company’s exit transactions were delayed as a result of this. Kenya’s real estate market also recorded the lowest capital appreciation compared to the previous six years, which is reflected in lower value uplift in our real estate portfolio during the financial year. • Rapproachment between the various political actors at the start of 2018 has reduced the political uncertainty. The post-election economic outlook is positive as the Government focuses on its ‘Big 4 Agenda’ and improved governance. INTEREST RATE CAPPING • The Banking Amendment Act 2016 introduced the capping of the local banks’ lending rate at a maximum of 4% above the Central Bank Rate which has adversely affected private sector credit growth. Within our portfolio, the interest rate capping had a negative impact on Sidian Bank Limited, which accounts for 6.4% of our Net Asset Value. The regulations also impacted the pace of unlocking of value in our real estate projects due to constrained credit access. • There is a recent proposal to repeal or modify the interest rate capping regulations, which would be expected to unlock credit growth to the private sector. FEDERAL RESERVE INTEREST RATE REVIEW • The Federal Reserve hiked its interest rate in 2018 with further indication of a possible increase in the coming 12 months. Due to the correlation between LIBOR and the Federal Rate, it is expected that the cost of foreign currency debt pegged on LIBOR could increase. The Company’slong term debt includes the equivalent of KES 5.8 Billion that is pegged to the LIBOR. • The effective cost of borrowing for the LIBOR pegged facility remains lower compared to the equivalent KES borrowings. Our strategy remains unchanged on raising project-specific debt at the project level that is non-recourse to Centum. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS 9 (IFRS 9) • IFRS 9 was adopted by local banks in January 2018. This standard, which affects our banking subsidiary Sidian Bank Limited, resulted in an increase in loan provisioning upon adoption. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has issued draft guidelines on IFRS 9 implementation which allow banks a five-year window to amortize the increased IFRS 9 loan provisions, for purposes of determining their capital adequacy. 16 CENTUM INVESTMENT COMPANY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018 MARKETABLE SECURITIES GROWTH 45.0% REAL ESTATE 40.7% DEVELOPMENT 3.8% 10.6% OUR BUSINESS Over the last 4 years, the Group’s investment portfolio has scaled up significantly.

Responsible investing entails having proper governance structures, concern for the environment and social responsibility. This policy ensures that all investments made by Centum not only generate desired return to shareholder’s capital, but also ensures that they benefit the society where they are made. Furthermore, the policy guides the investment team in making investments that protect and enhance positive effects to the environment. The RIP helps the Company promote its commitment to our stakeholders and to comply, at a minimum, with applicable local and international laws and regulations and, where appropriate, relevant International Standards where these are more stringent than the applicable laws. Furthermore, Centum, has Integrity as a core value and guiding principle. Integrity is embedded in the Centum culture through corporate governance initiatives and policy framework. Employees and directors of the company adhere to the Centum code of ethics, whistle-blowing policy and conflict of interest policy. The Company and its employees place integrity of the investment profession, governing rules of the Company and the Capital Markets above personal interests. M I N I M U M E N V I R O N M E N T A L S O C I A L G O V E R N A N C E S TA N DA R D S The Company is focused on investing in businesses which are committed to: a) Taking necessary measures to ensure equitable distribution of value across the supply chain in all its operations; b) A responsible approach to environmental management of their business operations (and those of their supply chain) by making efficient use of natural resources and mitigating environmental risks and damage; c) Respecting the human rights of their workers and of the people working in their supply chain; d) Maintaining safe and healthy working conditions for their employees and contractors and for the people working in their supply chain; e) Treating their employees fairly; f) Upholding the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining; and g) Treating their customers fairly and respecting the health, safety and wellbeing of those affected by their business activities. The minimum environmental, social and governance standards are considered at all stages of our investment processes and form part of our investment policy. I N V E S T M E N T P H I L O S O P H Y & S T R AT EGY Over the years, our business model has evolved and so has our investment philosophy. Centum invests in businesses and sectors that it understands well. Centum generally focuses on companies in sectors with: • Large and growing domestic and regional markets targeted principally at households and private businesses • Basic goods and services whose demand will increase as purchasing power increases • Products and services with limited scope for import substitution • Sustainable competitive advantage, with relatively high barriers to entry • Sectors with pricing power that will allow price increases with inflation • Relative industry certainty - where there are no adverse industry changes foreseeable within the investment period In cases where attractive opportunities exist in sectors that it does not have an understanding, we work to build expertise by engaging sector specialists from the investment appraisal stage or strategic partners to jointly invest. Our investment objectives are anchored around the following constraints; • Asset Allocation – ensuring a healthy balance of investments across various segments and portfolio classes (namely growth, real estate, cash and marketable securities and development) to minimize asset concentration risk and ensure a steady stream of cashflows to meet portfolio costs and take advantage of investment opportunities; • Legal & Regulatory Factors – paying due regard to the environment which we operate in; • Time Horizon – a balance is maintained between long and short-term investments to ensure consistent dividend payouts whilst maximising long term value; and • Sustainable Development – making conscious decisions to ensure responsible investing ethos on social, environmental and governance are applied towards greater value to the Company.

Our aim is to ensure that our SDG activities are well planned and both relevant to, and aligned with, our business strategy. We have identified 5 of the 17 SDGs as most relevant to our business and stakeholders, and on which we can have the most impact. These include: We also identified our potential impacts on these SDGs -both positive and negative. The process used to identify these SDGs and prioritize them for action was mapping the SDGs to our current primary investment and CSI activities. We also reviewed the 169 SDG targets to help identify connections between the goals and classified them according to a comparative level of relevance to our business. SDG #4 Status TARGETS 4.1 Free primary and secondary education 4.3 Equal access to affordable technical, vocational and higher education 4.A Build and upgrade inclusive and safe schools RELEVANCE 70% Positive Increase access to education at all our developments POTENTIAL IMPACT Alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 14 Centum Integrated Report SUSTAINABLE INVESTING Upgrading of Learning Infrastructure in Vipingo and Mathari Vipingo Development Ltd has committed to upgrading learning facilities within primary schools in Kilifi County. To date, we have put up new classrooms for two schools: Makonde and Timboni Primary schools at a total cost of KES 8 Million. In 2017, Centum’s Two Rivers Development Ltd, in collaboration with Nairobi City Council, surrounding community and others completed a CSI project to rebuild Old Mathari Primary School at a cost of over KES 180 million. The project increased the capacity of the school from 8 to 32 classrooms resulting in increased capacity from 845 students to 1,156 students. It also created employment opportunities for 18 new teachers in line with the increased number of students. Provision of Scholarships Centum Group provides at least 50 full scholarships every year to bright needy and eligible secondary school students from the Vipingo community who score 300 marks and above in Kenya Certificate of Primary Education. To date, we have awarded a total of 152 scholarships. We target to award 200 scholarships annually on a rolling basis. We also provide fully paid scholarship opportunities and refresher courses to eligible and qualified residents of the community who submit their application to join the vocational training facility. The scholarship opportunity is limited to one course and to date we have awarded 100 scholarships. Support of Mathari Primary School In 2018, Two Rivers and Centum Foundation teams marked the official launch of a long-term sports program with a Sports Day at the Two Rivers grounds. This is part of the ongoing support offered by Centum to the school and includes the automation of the administrative processes at Mathari Primary School. 15 Wastewater Management at Two Rivers At Two Rivers, we have the region’s largest reverse osmosis water treatment plant with capacity to treat 2 million litres of water per day. This reduces daily raw water consumption by 70% and allows for 80% of grey water to be recycled and treated to World Health Organisation standards. Green Energy at Two Rivers Sustainability has been a key consideration in the development of the Two Rivers precinct, with an installed solar energy capacity of 1.2 MW. This complements the grid supply that is distributed by Two Rivers Power Company, a licensed electricity distributor. Annual savings are approximated at KES 28 Million from the use of solar power within Two Rivers Development. Additionally, the use of solar power reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions by 534.84 tonnes per annum. Through the project company, Akiira Geothermal Limited, we are undertaking the development of a 140MW geothermal power plant in the Olkaria region of Nakuru County. The project will be undertaken in two phases, with the first phase involving the installation of 70MW. Upon completion, the Akiira geothermal power plant will be connected to the national grid, sustainably unlocking the vast geothermal potential within Kenya’s Rift Valley.

TSG will be working closely with NYS to ensure that the youth are deployed to its diverse job categories to ensure that opportunities are created to empower the youth. Additionally, another initiative launched through this MOU is the Ajiry platform which was developed to link employers with jobseekers while developing a track-record to promote youth employment. The second phase will involve development of Ajiry training centres that will promote education, training and onboarding onto the platform. Under the Vipingo vocational training program, the first 2 cohorts of 50 students each graduated in September and December 2018. 30 of the graduates have since found gainful employment with four currently working for Vipingo Development Limited. In line with SDG 8, the Centum Foundation through the Centum Entrepreneurship Program (CEP) identified and invested in ideas, start-up companies and existing small businesses. We offered seed funding and business support to the young entrepreneurs, nurtured them to grow their ideas and start-ups into well-established businesses. The CEP program was started in 2016 and to-date, we have invested over KES 30 million in 6 start-ups and smallscale businesses across various sectors ranging from e-commerce, edutech and FMCG. TARGETS 8.6 Promote youth employment, education and training POTENTIAL IMPACT RELEVANCE 50% Positive Increase access to youth opportunities by using ICT – the Ajiry program Negative Human rights infringement and child/ forced labor in supply chain SDG #8 Status 17 RELEVANCE POTENTIAL IMPACT Positive Enhancing the aesthetic value of the environment while incorporating green development initiatives. Sustainable and efficient use of resources when incorporating the use of renewable and clean sources of energy. Negative Reduced underground water infiltration as a result of built environments Increase In water stress as a result of water consumption during projects’ cycle. All master planned developments are required to have at a minimum 30% of the spatial area dedicated to green spaces to support improved quality of life and improve environmental compliance of our developments. Sea Water Desalination in Vipingo During the year ended 31 March 2019, we began construction of one of the biggest seawater desalination plants in the region with a capacity to supply 3 million litres of water per day. This will provide a reliable water supply to the development. Sustainable Use of Power and Water at Two Rivers 18,000 Kilowatts of the power consumed at the Two Rivers precint is from the installed solar energy at the Two Rivers Lifestyle Centre rooftop. Our main source of water at Two Rivers is from our treatment plant that has the ability to recycle and treat 300,000 litres of water per day. Two Rivers has been classified as a Vision 2030 Flagship project owing to its positive impact to the economy through the creation of employment opportunities. Future Action Our future reporting on the SDGs will be using the ‘SDGs Compass’. This reporting tool is developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and is widely recognized as a leading strategic tool to guide business action on the SDGs.

Over the next five years, our focus is on cash annuity income and holding optimal liquidity reserves. Investments will be in cash generative assets with no further capital deployments in new development assets. The key objectives for Centum 4.0 strategy are centered on five key pillars which are: Financial Objectives Return and Dividend Pay-out Generate a minimum return on equity of 20% through valuecreating activities. Optimise dividend pay-out to the higher of 30% of the cash annuity income (excluding capital gains) and the previous year’s dividend pay-out. Organizational Effectiveness Ensure optimisation of Centum’s operating model to support effective and efficient execution of its strategy including governance, structure, people, processes, technology and culture. Capital Structure and Liquidity Balance sheet strengthening through repayment of all longterm debt obligations (i.e. zero long-term debt capital structure) at Group level. All non-recourse debt will be taken at project/asset level. Double the book-value of shareholders’ funds to KES 100 billion by FY24. Portfolio Focus Restructure portfolio to focus on three key business units, namely: Real Estate (Target asset allocation: 45-55%) Private Equity (Target asset allocation: 30-40%) Marketable Securities (Target asset allocation: 10-20%) Operating Costs Maintain a maximum operating cost-to-cash annuity income ratio of 30%. 23 KEY MESSAGE OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT 24 Centum Integrated Report As an investment firm, our performance is closely aligned to that of the economy within the region we operate. The period under review was characterized by weakened economic activity, the depressed performance of securities and constrained performance. Given the underlying operating environment, the drivers of performance across our three business units are set out on page 84 of the CFO’s review. Private sector credit growth slowed down while capital costs increased, which has been the trend due to the tight lending restrictions imposed by commercial banks. The restricted lending is as a result of interest rate capping. This has adversely affected the performance of the real estate sector, as seen in the depressed uptake in the sale of land across our developments. However, despite this effect, we have experienced significant uptake in the sale of residential developments set out on page 107. Our competitive landscape continues to evolve with a number of Private Equity funds and Real Estate investors and developers intensifying their focus on the Kenyan and East Africa market as a whole. However, our positioning as the region’s leading master developer and investment partner, our capacity to raise capital and our intellectual and human capital, allows us to compete effectively. Our current strategy; Centum 4.0 is underpinned on intensive research and competitor analysis to ensure that we focus on delivering value for our stakeholders. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ECONOMY ECONOMIC HEADWINDS CONTINUE AS THE COUNTRY EXPERIENCES GDP GROWTH. REAL ESTATE POLICIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DRIVER OF GROWTH WITHIN THE SECTOR; FINANCIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN HIGHLY REGULATED. INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE.

Mbogo and Company Secretary Appointment Date: September 2018 60 | Centum Integrated Report CEO’s Statement We are Resilient | 61 It gives me great pleasure to present to you the Annual Integrated Report for our financial period 2019/2020, which is the first financial year in the Centum 4.0 five-year strategy period that commenced on April 1, 2019. We embarked on this strategy following very satisfactory execution of Centum 3.0 strategy, which came to an end on 31 March 2019. Performance over the Strategy Period As I reported in my letter last year, the gain in net worth over the five years of the 3.0 strategy period that ended 31 March 2019 was Ksh 29.7 billion, with the book value of shareholder funds increasing from Ksh 22.9 billion in 31 March 2014 to Ksh 52.6 billion in March 31, 2019. FY2019/2020 was the first year of the 4.0 strategy period and the book value of shareholder funds declined by Ksh 5.2 billion to Ksh 47.4 billion. The decline was largely on account of an impairment charge of Ksh 3.58 billion that was recognized in the year and a dividend payment of Ksh 799 million in the year. The impairment is largely in respect of provisions in our power development portfolio where, in the interest of prudence, we passed a 100% impairment of our investment in Amu Power Company following the decision of the National Environment Tribunal to revoke the Environmental Impact Assessment License that had been issued to the Amu Power Company. Although Amu Power has appealed the decision at the High Court, we were of the view that it was prudent to make a full provision of our investment in this company. At the Group level we recorded a 12% growth in Profit After Tax, which increased to Ksh 4.6 billion driven mainly by investment income. The make-up of the book value of shareholder funds by asset class as at 31 March 2019 and March 31 2020 is set out below: Table 1: Our portfolio composition Ksh. millions 31 March 2020 31 March 2019 Investment Portfolio* Private Equity 8,651 26,937 Real Estate 36,880 35,854 Marketable Securities and Cash 8,965 4,087 Development Portfolio 1,583 3,913 56,079 70,791 Other Assets 771 853 Total Assets 56,850 71,644 Borrowings 7,486 16,145 Other Liabilities 1,925 2,899 Shareholder Funds 47,439 52,600 * This classification is from an investment perspective and may slightly differ from the financial statements, which are presented strictly in accordance with the IFRS requirements. 62 | Centum Integrated Report CEO’s Statement Centum 4.0 Objective Actual Performance in the 2019/ 2020 Financial Year Return and Dividend payout: 1. Generate a minimum return on equity of 20%; 2. Optimise dividend payout to the higher of 30% of the cash annuity income and the previous year’s dividend income. 1. We achieved an average gross return on equity of 5.2% in FY2019/2020 as detailed below: Private Equity 13.4% Real Estate -1.8% Marketable Securities 7.5% Development 0.0% Average weighted return 5.2% 2. In the FY2019/2020 we maintained dividend at the previous year’s level of Ksh 1.20 per share in accordance with our policy bringing the total dividend for the year to Ksh 799 Million. Capital structure and liquidity: 1. Repayment of all long-term debt obligations. 2. Maintain a minimum of 12 months cash cover. 1. We had by March 31, 2020 repaid all the long-term debt save for Ksh 6.6 Billion in respect to the five-year corporate bond that was maturing in June 2020. We repaid the bond in full upon maturity and therefore achieved this strategic objective within 14 months of the commencement of the Centum 4.0 strategy period. 2. This objective was achieved having closed with cash and cash equivalents of Ksh 2.9 billion up from Ksh 253 million as at March 2019 which represents 55 months cash cover. Operating Costs 1. Maintain an average operating cost to cash annuity income ratio at a maximum of 30%. 1. In the period to March 2020, we achieved 50% cost to income ratio against the year’s target of 54%. The objective is to improve our cost efficiency and gradually reduce this ratio to an average of 30% over the strategy period. Portfolio Focus 1. Maintain focus on three business lines with target asset allocations as follows: ? Real estate: 45%-55% ? Private equity: 30%-40% ? Marketable securities: 10%-20% ? Development portfolio: 0% 1. At close of March 2020, our portfolio weighting was as follows: ? Real estate: 65% ? Private equity: 17% ? Marketable securities: 15% ? Development portfolio: 3% 2. We are actively pursuing a rebalancing of the portfolio as explained below, thus our 24 months outlook on the portfolio composition is: ? Real estate: 55% ? Private equity: 30% ? Marketable securities: 15% We are Resilient | 63 Asset Allocation Our private equity portfolio declined in value and weight during the year due to completion of the exit of Almasi Beverages, Nairobi Bottlers and King Beverage which generated proceeds of Ksh 19.6 billion. We applied these funds partly towards the reduction of our long-term debt, of which we retired USD 75 million (Ksh 7.8 billion) facility ahead of its maturity and fully redeemed Ksh 6.6 billion five-year bond that matured subsequent to year end in June 2020. The balance of sale proceeds were used to increase our investment in marketable securities and cash which stood at Ksh 8.9 billion in FY2020 up from Ksh 4.1 billion in FY2019. The decision to exit the bottling companies in FY2020 has turned out to have been very timely as it enabled us to unlock and preserve the value we had created in these assets, which would otherwise have been adversely impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic. We are now well positioned to redeploy to private equity as we look to finalize the set up our Centum Private Equity Value Fund II. We have committed circa Ksh 6 billion to the fund that we expect to fully deploy within the Centum 4.0 strategy period. We are currently overweight on the real estate asset class largely on account of a growth in value over time and as a result of the exits we have realized in the private equity asset class. Our strategic objective is to rebalance the overall portfolio by releasing liquidity from the real estate portfolio for re-investment in the private equity asset class, which we are currently underweight. We closed FY2019/2020 with various transactions at advanced stages to unlock up to Ksh 6.0 billion from the real estate asset class. We had by June concluded a release of Ksh 4 billion and we expect to conclude the balance of Ksh 2 billion by the end of the current financial year. The objective over the remaining three years of Centum 4.0 will be to release a further Ksh 10 billion from the real estate asset class which will be funded through a distribution of dividends from the ongoing infill residential developments, bulk land sales and the refinancing of the shareholder loans that Centum has in the past advanced the real estate project companies for reallocation to the private equity and marketable securities asset classes. The ongoing infill residential projects that were 70% sold as at 31 March 2020 have a dividend distribution potential of Ksh 3.2 billion that we expect to be distributed to Centum over the next 3 years. Closing the Price to NAV Gap In my last year’s letter, I set out our strategy for closing the Price to NAV gap. A major component of our strategy was the repayment of debt so as to enable us to direct the close to Ksh 1.8 billion that we have been incurring annually on interest payments towards dividend enhancement. I am pleased to report that we have now achieved the debt repayment objective having since repaid close to Ksh 14.4 billion in long term debt. We financed this objective through the sales of our stake in the bottlers and the repayment of shareholder loans of Ksh 4 billion that we had advanced our real estate subsidiaries. In addition, we have enhanced our investment focus on assets that can provide us with steady and consistent cash flow streams. We therefore increased our holdings of marketable securities and cash, which is largely made up of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities from Ksh 4.1 billion to Ksh 8.9 billion. The deleveraging of the Company balance sheet and the marketable securities portfolio rebalancing in favor of fixed income securities that we began as part of the Centum 4.0 strategy has significantly insulated both our balance sheet and cash flow from the negative economic effects of Covid-19. It has also placed us in a good position to take advantage of investment opportunities that may emerge as the economy recovers from the Covid–19 crisis.

Infill projects – sale and development of infill projects on our current land banks to activate them. ii. Land sales – sale of bulk land and development rights within our current land banks to third party codevelopers. iii. Rentals property management – management of our existing rental assets such as Two Rivers mall, Two Rivers offices, Two Rivers Theme Park and Pearl Marina Signature Villas. iv. Third party projects – pursue affordable housing development in joint venture arrangements with third party landowners at strategic sites. In the real estate business segment, we have made exceptional progress in rolling out a pipeline of residential anchor projects, all of which are on course for completion per schedule. The business currently has an approval to sell and develop a scheme of 4,426 units across our three sites at Two Rivers (Nairobi, Kenya), Vipingo (Kilifi, Kenya) and Pearl Marina (Entebbe, Uganda) as well as in partnership with third-party land owners. At the close of FY2020, we had 1,442 units under construction of which 999 or approximately 70% had been sold; with some of the first batches of Awali Estate (Vipingo), Palm Ridge (Vipingo) and Mirabella Villas (Pearl Marina) set to be handed over to the buyers in the second half of 2020. The value of the pre-sold units as at March 31, 2020 was Ksh 7.8 billion, up from Ksh 3.8 Billion as at 31 March 2019. The business model of our infill development business is to reduce the market risk of the development by achieving a minimum 30% pre-sales level prior to the commencement of each development.
